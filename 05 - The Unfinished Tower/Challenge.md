The Grinch has developed a rogue AI designed to spread chaos across the digital world.

Fortunately, the elves from the Cyber Defense Squad have traced one of its data fragments to an open project space somewhere in North Africa.

They discovered a mysterious digital footprint under the alias "Unfinished-Explorer", containing cryptic GPS coordinates and poetic clues about an “unfinished monument guarded by silence.”

Rumor has it that his last clue is hidden among his unfinished dreams, freely accessible to anyone who knows where to look.

Your mission: follow the coordinates, investigate the area, and uncover the name of the resting place that holds the secret to neutralizing the AI’s plan.

The format of the flag is **ADV{something}**
