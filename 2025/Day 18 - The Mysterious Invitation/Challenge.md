While the elves were trying to hack into the Grinch’s evil AI,
a strange file suddenly appeared on their computer MoroccoChecker.
No extension, no instructions, no mercy.

Rumor says the Grinch hid a secret invitation to one of his exclusive villain parties somewhere in Morocco.
Only those clever enough to reverse-engineer the file can earn the pass!

But beware… this file loves to mock failed attempts:

“HoHoo! Sorry, try again.”

Can you uncover the invitation and prove to the elves that Morocco hides more secrets than it seems ?

The format of the flag is ADV{something}
