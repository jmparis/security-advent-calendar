Ho ho ho! Santa needs your help to save this year's gift delivery.
He has a new software to manage his gift distribution list, but Father Frost (Grinch's associate) slipped a critical vulnerability into one of its components!

If you don't find it, there will be no presents for children around the world.
It's your turn: hunt it down and make sure Christmas remains magical and secure!

The format of the flag is **ADV{something}**
