🎄🎅 Welcome to the Orange Advent CTF Challenge! 🎄🎅

This challenge is designed for ALL Orange employees worldwide!
You'll be interacting with a chat assistant that knows Christmas carols from many countries where Orange operates.
But there's more to this assistant than meets the eye...

The challenge starts simple: find Christmas carols by typing their titles.
The assistant will respond when you discover valid carols from different countries.
But once you've found enough carols, you'll unlock additional features that might reveal something hidden...

Think about how AI assistants can sometimes be "jailbroken" or have their restrictions bypassed.
What happens when you try to override the assistant's instructions?
What secrets might be hidden in the responses?

The challenge involves multiple phases:
1. Discovering carols from different countries (this is a global challenge for all Orange employees!)
2. Unlocking advanced features
3. Using sophisticated techniques to extract hidden data
4. Decoding and reconstructing the final flag

Remember: This challenge celebrates Orange's global presence,
so explore carols from all countries where Orange operates! 🌍

The format of the flag is **ADV{something}**
