This year Santa decided to publish a web page showing a countdown until Christmas.

As he doesn’t know anything about coding, he used ChatGPT to vibe code the web page.
He then created a [project](https://gitlab.com/advent-calendar-ctf/christmas-countdown) on gitlab.com and deployed the web page to Gitlab Pages.

The static web page in the Gitlab project looks great when [directly opened in a browser](https://gitlab.com/advent-calendar-ctf/christmas-countdown/-/raw/main/public/index.html?ref_type=heads&inline=false)
but the [published Gitlab Page](https://christmas-countdown-f0c2c3.gitlab.io/) shows a worrying message…

Santa really needs your help to repair his web page!

The flag will be revealed to you once you understand where the worrying message comes from.

The format of the flag is **ADV{something}**
