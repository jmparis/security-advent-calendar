For Christmas, Magnus received a strange electronic chessboard (probably corrupted by the Grinch's IA),
which seems to start directly on an incomplete game that he is unable to name.
Indeed, the missing move seems to be hidden in a binary file called ‘chess_game’,
which could be also very useful in finding the name of this famous game...

Your mission is to help Magnus recover the **missing move** and the **name of this game**.

By entering the **FEN code of the last position of the game** into the verifier available at the following address,
you'll be given the flag.

The format of the flag is **ADV{something}**.

PS: As this challenge has been simplified as much as possible for obvious reasons,
it does not require any execution of the executable file or any dynamic analysis.
