Can you reconstitute the second line of a suspicious passport held by the Grinch ?

The format of the flag is **ADV{something}**.

Note:
As some of you noticed, the computation of check digits in this challenge differs from MRZ specifications and
from those computed on websites.

For this challenge, the check digits are computed for the entire zone and
not only the numeric values.

<poor excuse>
The purpose was to force you to do computation by hand, obviously. 😁
