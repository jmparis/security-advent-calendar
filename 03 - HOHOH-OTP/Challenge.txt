Santa Claus is about to set off on his journey, but the sleigh's GPS seems frozen in TIME. He can't enter his TOTP authentication code given by his mobile phone to unlock it. Usually, the code changes every 30s, but not anymore.

Without his GPS, he won't be able to deliver the presents. He suspects the Grinch is making another attempt to sabotage Christmas, as a CCTV image was found nearby the sleigh.
